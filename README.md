### Indian Startups Ecosystem

## Introduction
In this article, we examine India’s startup ecosystem between 2018 and 2021.

During this period, India witnessed a significant rise in the number of startups and funding opportunities.

In 2020 alone, over 16,000 new tech companies emerged. Despite facing challenges in securing funding, investment firms displayed confidence in Indian startups, allocating a total budget of $8.4 billion in 2023.

This project aims to scrutinize the funding patterns within the Indian startup landscape and recommend strategies for entering this vibrant market. We employ the Python programming language and adhere to the CRISP-DM methodology to analyze data and extract valuable insights.

Before proceeding further, let’s establish our hypotheses:

H0: There is no significant relationship between funding and sector.
H1: There is a significant relationship between funding and the sector.

The following questions will be addressed:
-How have funding trends evolved between 2018 and 2021?
-What is the relationship between the amount of funding and the stage of the company?
-How does funding vary with the location of startups?
-What are the most attractive sectors for investors?
-Does the location of the company influence its sector?

## Project Structure
-Business Understanding: In this stage, we gain an understanding of the startup funding landscape in India and the objectives of our analysis.
-Data Understanding: We collect data from different sources, including a database, OneDrive, and GitHub repository. We explore the datasets to understand their structure and variables.
-Data Preparation: We clean the data, handle missing values, address inconsistencies, and merge the datasets to create a comprehensive dataset spanning 2018 to 2021.
-Evaluation: We evaluate the analysis outcomes based on total funding amount, growth rate, and sector-wise distribution. We also test the hypotheses to determine the relationship between funding and the sector.
- Deployment: We communicate the findings, propose the best course of action for venturing into the Indian startup ecosystem, outline potential investment opportunities, and provide insights and recommendations to address the questions posed.

## Results:
## How have funding trends evolved between 2018 and 2021?
In 2018–2019, funding levels were relatively low across various sectors and industries. However, as 2021 unfolded, a significant change occurred as funding began to rise steadily. By the end of 2021, the total funding surged to an impressive $179 billion, marking a substantial increase compared to the preceding years.

This upward trend in funding signifies growing investor confidence and opportunities, indicating a potentially robust economic environment conducive to innovation and growth.

## What is the relationship between the amount of funding and the stage of the company?
Funding across different stages varied, with the ‘Others’ category receiving the most funding. ‘Others’ remained in the lead, getting around $246 million per funding, showcasing a diverse investment scene.


In comparison to total funding, the ‘exit option’ stage typically received more average funding than the validation stage, suggesting investors favored more established ventures.

## How does funding vary with the location of startups?
On average, startups based in Mumbai secured the highest funding at over 140 B. This is followed by a big deep in startups in Bangalore, followed by Gurgaon, and those in Delhi with the least.


## What are the most attractive sectors for investors?
Our examination revealed two standout sectors: fintech and retail. Within the top ten most funded sectors by total funding, fintech and retail emerged as prominent leaders. These sectors not only attracted significant investor interest but also showcased promising prospects for expansion and innovation.


With their solid funding levels, evident investor interest, and promising potential for innovation and growth, these sectors present fertile ground for entrepreneurial ventures.

## Does the location of the company influence its sector?
Our analysis indicates that although certain companies are headquartered abroad, the top sectors predominantly concentrate in Indian cities.

## Hypothesis:
We hypothesized that there might not be a significant association between these factors. However, upon conducting our analysis, we found no compelling evidence to refute this hypothesis. Thus, a startup’s sector does not strongly determine the amount of funding it obtains.

The p-value, which was calculated as 0.999999, indicates the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between the sectors. A p-value close to 1 suggests little distinction between sectors. Also, the F statistic, computed as 0.0628352704331516 serves as a measure of the differences between sectors. A low F statistic suggests minimal disparity, supporting the conclusion that a startup’s sector has little impact on its funding.

Therefore, the data indicates that whether a startup operates in technology, finance, or any other sector, its funding is not necessarily determined by its industry affiliation.

## Recommendations:
Based on our analysis, we propose the following recommendations:

## Location Consideration:
Investors should focus on top-funded locations like Mumbai, Shanghai, San Francisco, Kalpakkan, and Beijing. These locations have demonstrated high investment activity and potential for startup success.

2. Sector-Specific Investments:

Sector doesn’t really matter. However, fintech and retail stand out as the most attractive sectors for investors. These sectors have shown significant growth and funding potential, making them promising avenues for investment.

3. Emerging Trends:

Monitor trends in mature startups in the ‘Others’ category, signaling investor comfort with later-stage ventures. Keep an eye on evolving sub-sectors and emerging technologies within the startup ecosystem.

4. Diversification:

Diversify portfolios across locations and sectors for a balanced risk-return profile. Investing in a mix of geographical locations and sectors can mitigate risks associated with a single location or industry and maximize potential returns.

## Conclusion
Through the above analysis and testing of hypotheses, we have gained valuable insights into the funding trends in the Indian startup ecosystem. By considering location, sector-specific investments, emerging trends, and diversification, investors can make informed decisions and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the Indian startup ecosystem.
